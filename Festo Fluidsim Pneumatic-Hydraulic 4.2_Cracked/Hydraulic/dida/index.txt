If the pressure is decreased even further (now 1 MPa), then ultimately the piston does not move at all. This is due to the fact that the piston force necessary to move the 300 kg mass diminishes and at a certain level it is insufficient to overcome the static friction.

1.	The theoretical piston force Fth by 6 MPa system pressure is calculated as follows (see theoretical piston force p1_2_2_1).  
2.	In order to the move the mass, we first have to overcome the static friction. For this, the break-away force FB  is calculated as follows (see Cylinder model - Friction p1_3_13_1_1):  
The theoretical piston force amounts to 1205.8 N which is therefore sufficient to set the cylinder piston (and with it, the external mass) horizontally in motion.

The inertia of the mass affects the acceleration. The larger the mass to be moved, the lower the acceleration. This needs to be considered for the desired procedural speed. You can find out more about the influence of the moment of inertia in the experiment moment of inertia p1_1_3.

When the pressure is decreased (here 3 MPa), the piston moves slower. The forces of friction and inertia ensure that the integrated pressure relief valve in the pump unit opens and thus limits the system pressure to the pre-set operating pressure. The lower the setting of the operating pressure, the more hydraulic fluid drains via the pressure relief valve and a lower flow rate is available for the piston movement.

A cylinder needs to be chosen with a piston force that is greater than the force of gravity on the mass to be lifted. Bear in mind, that friction does not play a part when vertically lifting a mass (cos(90°)=0, see cylinder model - friction p1_3_13_1_1).  The following steps need to be performed when choosing a cylinder:    ·	calculate the force of gravity on the mass to be lifted.  ·	define, with the use of data sheets or calculation, (see excursus Calculating the theoretical and effective piston force p1_2_2) the minimum piston diameter necessary to lift the mass at an operating pressure of 6 MPa.

Change the cylinder parameters in accordance with your calculations and simulate the circuit diagram.    Theoretically, a minimum of 25 mm piston diameter by 6 MPa is necessary to lift 300 kg. In comparison, a 10 mm piston diameter is sufficient to move the same mass with an external friction of 0.1 - 0.15.    However, in practice and in the simulation with FluidSIM, static friction effects occur at the cylinder piston causing the cylinder piston not to extend. Therefore an approx. 10% larger piston diameter of 28 mm is chosen.

Experiments
The law of inertia defines the term inertia as follows:    "An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force."    The cause of every change of movement (acceleration) is a force. The relationship between force, mass and acceleration is described by the following equation:    
Law of Inertia
i.e. the force is proportional to the product of the mass times the acceleration. It follows that, the larger the mass, the greater the force must be in order to achieve the same acceleration.

The cylinder piston again extends with an oscillating speed and acceleration. Due to the counteracting force, the maximum speed remains sufficiently low and the inlet pressure does not fall below the vapour pressure.

follows
This means that by increasing the mass, the acceleration, with a constant force, is reduced. As the operating pressure is limited to 6 MPa (60 bar), then the theoretical piston force p1_2_2 is limited to 1206 N and with it the acceleration to approx. 2.4 m/s2 . The acceleration is significantly lower than in the previous experiment with 10 kg moving mass. This leads to a reduction in the oscillation frequency.

The cylinder piston does not extend with a constant velocity, instead the velocity oscillates at approx. 0.17 m/s with attenuating amplitude. This is also true for the acceleration and inlet pressure at the cylinder. In doing so, it causes an additional undesired effect. The pressure occasionally falls below the vapour pressure of the hydraulic fluid, which can lead to cavitation effects (see Ccavitation und vapour pressure p1_2_1_5).    Shortly after the simulation starts, the pressure increases in the left cylinder chamber and the piston accelerates to approx. 0.3 m/s. The counteracting force is primarily just the frictional force of the cylinder piston, as the right chamber is directly connected to the tank via the directional valve and can therefore only build up a low counter pressure. At 0.3 m/s approx. 3.62 l/min flow in to the left cylinder chamber (q=A·v). However only 2 l/min return from the pump unit. Therefore the inlet pressure falls below the vapour pressure. Only when the cylinder has been braked so far that more oil returns than drains, does the pressure increase and the cylinder accelerates again. This oscillation is absorbed further and further through the friction losses.     The moving cylinder mass is mounted between two oil reservoirs. The changes of movement of the cylinder mass and the pressure changes in the oil reservoir, are carried out at different speeds and therefore the complete system is capable of oscillation. In control engineering this is also known as a second order system (PT2-System) [1] p1_4_2.

In the previous experiment, the inlet pressure occasionally fell below the vapour pressure of the hydraulic fluid. This undesirable effect can be avoided, when the back pressure in the right cylinder chamber is so high that the procedural speed remains slow enough and a sufficient volumetric flow can return.    The simplest method is to install a throttle valve in the cylinder discharge. A similar effect can be achieved with pressure relief valves, flow control valves or complicated circuitry methods.    The hydraulic resistance at complete opening is 0.045 MPa/(l/min)2 and the opening level is set to 10%.     Simulate the circuit diagram and describe the result.

The unit of measurement for pressure is 1 Pa (see SI-units p1_4_1). Various pressure sizes are used for which different descriptions are generally in use [2] p1_4_2. The most important descriptions, as recommended in the DIN standard 1314, are:    ·	Absolute pressure  	the absolute pressure applies to absolute zero (vacuum).    ·	Atmospheric pressure  	the atmospheric pressure is the absolute pressure, as ascertained at the measuring-point. This is not constant and is dependent upon geographical position or weather.    ·	Excess pressure  	the excess pressure is the pressure ascertained at the measuring-point, in relation to the atmospheric pressure as zero point. Gauges in pneumatic systems usually display the excess pressure. Excess pressure is also known as effective pressure or relative pressure.    In hydraulics the pressures are generally denoted as excess pressure.

The tenacity or viscosity of a hydraulic fluid is defined as the resistance that is opposed to a displacement of adjacent fluid layers. It is a material property of the fluid and basis for the calculation of hydraulic resistances  [8] p1_4_2. One differentiates between dynamic viscosity h and kinematic viscosity n. Viscosity is determined with standard procedures e.g. as per DIN 51562 with the "Ubbelohde-Viscometer" and as per DIN 51561 with the "Vogel-Ossag-Viscometer". For the detemination of kinematic viscosity, the "Ball viscometer" can also be utilised. With these procedures the viscosity values in a wide area can be very precisely determined [3] p1_4_2. The speed is measured with which a body, under the influence of gravity, sinks in fluid. The measured value is equivalent to the dynamic viscosity.    To attain the kinematic viscosity n , the dynamic viscosity h must be divided by the density r of the fluid:

In oil hydraulics the units mPa×s (milli Pascal seconds) are frequently used for the dynamic viscosity and mm2/s or cSt (centi Stokes) resp. for the kinematic viscosity.    Viscosity is a material property that is dependent upon temperature and pressure. The pressure dependence is often neglected. The viscosity of fluids decreases by increasing temperature - by gases the viscosity increases. In FluidSIM the kinematic viscosity is assumed to be a constant 22 mm2/s (cSt).

By the laminar flow, the hydraulic fluid moves in the pipe in orderly, cylindrical layers. Thereby the inner fluid layers have a greater velocity than the outer layers. If the flow rate of the hydraulic fluid increases then, at a certain velocity (known as the critical velocity), the fluid particles do not move in orderly layers. The fluid particles in the middle of the pipe escape to the side. Thus the fluid particles influence and obstruct themselves mutually, vortices are formed, the flow becomes turbulent. As a consequence the main flow is deprived of energy.

In connection with flow resistances, the characteristic length l as hydraulic diameter DH is defined such that DH conforms to a circular cross-section with the geometric diameter d of the circle.

For a narrow gap with a low height h as opposed to the width b the following applies:  
The critical Reynolds-Number Recrit indicates the value at which a transition from laminar flow to turbulent flow occurs. The critical Reynolds-Number is not constant, instead it depends upon the component through which the oil flows. The transition from laminar to turbulent flow occurs in a smooth pipe at approx.  Recrit = 2300. This transition is reached with other flow resistances at even smaller Reynolds-numbers of approx. Re = 200.     A turbulent flow is not immediately laminar, if it remains below Recrit. The laminar range is not reached again before ½ Recrit .

Excursus
Friction occurs in all perfused devices and pipelines of a hydraulic system.    This is primarily the friction at the pipeline walls (exterior friction). In addition there is the friction between the fluid layers (interior friction). The friction leads to a temperature rise in the hydraulic fluid and, consequently, in the components too. As a result of this heat development, the pressure falls in the system and thereby reduces the effective pressure at the drive section. The component represents a hydraulic resistance.    The relationship between volumetric flow and pressure loss is essentially dependent upon whether a laminar or turbulent flow exists in the observed component. The Reynolds-number (see Reynolds-number p1_2_1_4_1) serves as measure for the flow type.

Resistance of components to laminar flow
The following applies to the flow through a rectangular gap:
with    	q	 = flow rate [m3/s]  	Dp	 = pressure loss at the throttle point [Pa]  	h	 = dynamic viscosity [Pa×s]  	l	 = throttle point length [m]  	r	 = throttle point radius [m]  	b	 = gap width [m]    Combining all component parameters to one parameter results in the following relationship:
The volumetric flow is therefore directly proportional to the pressure difference and inversely proportional to the dynamic viscosity. As the viscosity is very dependent on temperature, so the flow property of the laminar flow is also dependent upon temperature.     In FluidSIM, the pipelines (connections between the components) are modeled ideally and therefore no pressure losses occur in the pipelines. A pressure loss can, however, be simulated by using a throttle as resistance.

The determination of the flow coefficient has been the subject of very extensive investigations, as every cross-section shape possesses different values regarding the geometry of the leading edge.     While the volumetric flow through gaps and throttles is directly proportional to the pressure difference Dp and inversely proportional to the dynamic viscosity, for the orifices there is a root-shaped dependence upon the pressure difference. Orifices are preferable to throttles as technical resistances, while the flow law is predominantly viscosity dependent and therefore also temperature dependent.   Combining all component parameters to one parameter k (hydraulic conductance) results in the following relationship:

The flow rate model specified under resistance of orifices p1_2_1_4_4_1 is also used for the modeling of the flow rate of slide valves [1, 4] p1_4_2. By servo valves and control valves,  the aim is to achieve a linear relationship between the slide distance x and the released area A . This is technically implemented by the use of rectangular shaped leading edges. The flow rate and the slide distance doubles when the pressure is kept constant.

Tutorial < Excursus < Physical Essentials < Cavitation
Excursus
If the flow velocity of the oil at the throttle point increases, then kinetic energy is required. The kinetic energy is withdrawn from this pressure energy. This can result in a pressure loss in the negative pressure area at this throttle point. From a negative pressure of -30 kPa (-0.3 bar) onwards, dissolved air escapes from the oil. Gas bubbles form. If the pressure increases again due to a speed reduction, the oil rushes into the gas bubbles. Due to the high pressure after the throttle point, very high temperatures develop caused by the collapse of the bubbles through the air compression. This process is called cavitation (cavitare = hollow out). This can lead to the spontaneous combustion - similar to that in a diesel motor (diesel effect) - of the oil/air mix in the bubbles. At the site of the cross-section extension small particles break away from the material. This leads to material fatigue and often also to destruction.

Oil is compressible. If a fluid is exposed to pressure then its volume decreases due the dissolved gases therein. The compressible range amounts to 1-3% of the output volume. The pressure energy is low due to the low compressibility of the hydraulic fluid, i.e. the relatively small DV. At a pressure of 100 bar, DV amounts to approx. 1% of the output volume. There follows a calculation based on these values.

Pressure energy results from the pressure that the fluid opposes to the compression.     All materials can be compressed. This means, that if the initial pressure p0 is increased by the value Dp, then the initial volume V0 is decreased by the value DV. This compressibility is increased by the gases dissolved in the oil (up to 9 %) and the increasing temperature. The characteristic for this is the bulk modulus BOil. The compressibility of the oil is described mathematically through:

The components surrounding the oil also expand under pressure. It has therefore become widely acceptable to combine all elasticities involved in the pressure build-up in one variable, the equivalent bulk modulus B'Oil. The apostrophe is used to differentiate between the bulk modulus of the oil and the equivalent bulk modulus; it does not describe a derivative of the value BOil. The equivalent bulk modulus B'Oil is generally not constant and takes various parameters into account such as: pressure; temperature; the proportion of dissolved air and the elasticity of the containers [1] p1_4_2.    FluidSIM calculates with a constant equivalent bulk modulus of 1.4×109 Pa.

In FluidSIM models, lumped volumes are used to calculate the fluctuations in pressure over a period of time. This means that the oil volumes in the component connections are combined. Furthermore, temperature fluctuations are not considered, i.e. the temperature is assumed to be a constant 293.15 K (20 °C).  If oil flows under pressure in an enclosed reservoir V, then the pressure in this reservoir changes. This is described with the following differential equation [1] p1_4_2:

The bulk modulus B'Oil is dependent upon pressure, temperature and the proportion of undisssolved air in the hydraulic fluid (see compressibility of hydraulic fluids p1_2_1_7). FluidSIM disregards this dependence and calculates with a constant equivalent bulk modulus of 1.4×109 Pa and a volume V= 10-4 m3 (0.1 l).

The calculated pressure increase can easily be verified in FluidSIM. For this purpose, a simplified pump unit is necessary, with a blind plug over the port. An operating pressure of 6 MPa and a delivery rate of 0.1 l/min has to be specified. Start the simulation in single-step mode and display the pressure values at the port. Carry out single steps until the operating pressure has reached 6 MPa. According to the example calculation, the operating pressure is attained in  
Comparison: calculation und simulation
In the simulation a pressure of 5.99 MPa is attained precisely within this time. As before reaching the operating pressure an internal pressure-relief valve in the pump unit opens, less than 0.1 l/min flow into the reservoir and 6 MPa is first reached after 0.306 s.

In practice, the effective piston force is of importance. The frictional resistance of the cylinder needs to be taken into account when calculating the effective piston force. Under normal operating conditions, the frictional force (frictional resistance of the sealing elements) used for the estimation of the effective piston force, can be assumed to be approx. 10% of the theoretical piston force. FluidSIM uses a more complex friction model for the dynamic simulation (see cylinder model p1_3_13).    The following formula can be used to estimate the effective piston force:    Double acting cylinder (forward stroke):    	Feff = A1 · p1 - FF with    FF frictional force (approx. 10% from Fth)     Double acting cylinder (reverse stroke):    	Feff = A2 · p2 - FF with    FF frictional force (approx. 10% from Fth)    Single acting cylinder with return spring (forward stroke):    	Feff = A1 · p1 - FF - FS with    FF frictional force (approx. 10% from Fth)  FS return spring force

The pump unit model takes three parameters into account:    ·	operating pressure  ·	flow  ·	internal leakage    As long as the operating pressure has not been reached, the unit constantly supplies the pre-set flow. The pressure results from the resistance of the attached components. Close to the operating pressure, the delivery flow rate drops until, at operating pressure, it reaches exactly zero.    If an internal leakage greater than zero is specified, then the delivery rate is reduced by the leakage flow (rate). The leakage flow is modeled as a laminar flow p1_2_1_4_3.

The flow dividing valve divides the flow rate from port 0 equally to port 3 and port 4. This is achieved using two measuring orifices R1 and R2, each with the same constant resistance and two variable control resistors. The control resistors are unified in a pressure compensator.    The pressures p1 and p2 are compared with the pressure compensator. By unequal pressures, the control slide valve extends and changes the cross-section area of the leading edges, which leads to a flow rate increase or decrease over the leading edge resp. The effects of flow forces and the forces of inertia are ignored by the flow dividing valve in FluidSIM. The control slide valve proceeds so long until the adjacent forces are balanced and p1 = p2 is valid.    The pressure differences at the measuring orifices R1 und R2 are therefore equal (p0 - p1 = p0 - p2). As both measuring orifices have the same resistance, then their volumetric flow is also equal.    A hydraulic resistance can be defined in FluidSIM. This refers to the individual measuring orifices and the completely opened leading edges respectively.

The valve is closed in the idle position. The hydraulic fluid drains off at T, when the pressure difference at the ports P and T exceeds the nominal pressure. If the pressure falls below the preset value, the valve closes again.     The piloted pressure relief valve consists of a pilot stage, a main stage and an orifice (R). When open, there is less volumetric flow at the pilot stage that leads to port Y.    When closed, there is no volumetric flow at the orifice R. The pressures pP and pD, adjacent to the  pressure compensator of the main stage, are equal, and the main stage remains closed due to the low spring force. The pilot stage opens as soon as its' preset opening pressure is exceeded. A lower volumetric flow drains off at the leading edge of the pilot stage. This leads to a fall in pressure at the orifice R. pP is now larger than pD, and the main stage opens as soon as the spring force is overcome.  The piloted pressure relief valve is especially suitable for larger flow rates, as the pressure increase of pP is only dependent upon the low volumetric flow of the pilot stage.    Two parameters can be defined in FluidSIM:    ·	nominal pressure (inlet pressure) of the pilot stage  ·	hydraulic resistance of the fully opened main stage    In FluidSIM the main stage opens at a pressure of 0.05 MPa (0.5 bar), the hydraulic resistance of the orifice R is 1 MPa/(l/min)2 and the hydraulic resistance of the fully opened pilot stage 0.01 MPa/(l/min)2.

The piloted pressure regulating valve consists of a pilot stage, a main stage and an orifice (R).  If the pilot stage is closed, then there is no volumetric flow at the orifice R. The pressures pA und pD, adjacent to the pressure compensator of the main stage, are equal and the main stage remains closed due to the low spring force. The pilot stage opens as soon as its' preset opening pressure is exceeded. A lower volumetric flow drains off at the leading edge of the pilot stage. This leads to a fall in pressure at the orifice R. pA is now larger than pD, and the main stage begins to close as soon as the spring force is overcome.    The piloted pressure regulating valve is especially suitable for larger flow rates, as the pressure increase of pA is only dependent upon the low volumetric flow of the pilot stage.    Two parameters can be defined in FluidSIM:    ·	nominal pressure (inlet pressure) of the pilot stage  ·	hydraulic resistance of the fully opened main stage    In FluidSIM the main stage closes at a pressure of 0.05 MPa (0.5 bar), the hydraulic resistance of the orifice R is 1 MPa/(l/min)2 and the hydraulic resistance of the fully opened pilot stage 0.01 MPa/(l/min)2.

All models in FluidSIM have been created using the modeling language Modelicaã [7] p1_4_2. Modelica is a freely available, object-oriented modeling language for large, complex and heterogeneous technical systems. Models of different domains can be described using Modelica e.g. mechanics, electrical engineering, hydraulics and pneumatics. Models are mathematically described in Modelica using differential, algebraic and discrete equations. More information can be found at www.Modelica.org. A separate Modelica-library was especially developed for FluidSIM which does not use any models contained in the Modelica standard library.    A new, highly efficient, state-of-the-art Modelica simulator was developed for FluidSIM, for the calculation of the models described with Modelica. The simulator falls back on a number of symbolic and numerical methods for the solution of linear, non-linear and differential-algebraic equations.    Various integration algorithms are available to the simulator that can be intelligently selected and controlled at runtime. Integration algorithms implemented amongst others are:   ·	explicit single-step method, e.g. Dormand-Prince [5] p1_4_2  ·	implicit single-step method, e.g. Radau5 [6] p1_4_2  ·	explicit multiple-step method, e.g. Adams [5] p1_4_2  ·	implicit multiple-step method, e.g. Gear [5, 6] p1_4_2    All algorithms are equipped with an incremental control and facilitate the selection of any interpolated interim values. (Dense-Output).

Model of the pump
Mathematical models
The pump model takes four parameters into account:    ·	revolution  ·	displacement   ·	maximum pressure  ·	internal leakage    The pump delivers a volumetric flow that results from the product of revolutions and displacement volume. The volumetric flow remains constant as long as the maximum pressure has not been reached. The pump can only deliver the specified volumetric flow when sufficient hydraulic fluid returns via the suction connection.     The pressure results from the resistance of the attached components. Close to the maximum pressure, the delivery flow rate drops until, at the specified pressure, it reaches exactly zero. In practice, exceeding the maximum pressure can lead to pump damage. FluidSIM does not take this into account.    If an internal leakage greater than zero is specified, then the delivery rate is reduced by the leakage flow (rate). The leakage flow is modeled as a laminar flow p1_2_1_4_3.

Mathematical models
The construction of a hydraulic reservoir consists of a pressure resistant container, a gas charge of nitrogen and a separator, e.g. a piston or an elastomer.    Internally the reservoir in FluidSIM is composed of two components: the actual reservoir in which the pressure build-up takes place and a laminar throttle p1_2_1_4_3 with low resistance, through which the hydraulic fluid flows into the reservoir.    Two parameters can be specified in FluidSIM:    ·	volume V0  ·	gas-preload pressure p0    The following equation is used - in the reservoir - to calculate the absolute pressure p1:

The change in pressure is executed so slowly that a complete heat exchange with the environment takes place.    For n = 1.4 an adiabatic transformation of state is assumed. The change in pressure is executed so quickly that no heat exchange with the environment takes place. FluidSIM calculates with n = 1.4.    The gas volume V1 results from the difference between the gas volume V0 and the flowed volume of hydraulic fluid.

The flow rate is calculated using the flow rate model for turbulent flow p1_2_1_4_4. The hydraulic resistance can be specified either direct or graphically for these components.    Adjustable flow control valves and orifices are also classed as components with a constant cross-section, as the cross-section can only be changed manually and is not pressure dependent.    The hydraulic resistance is converted internally to the hydraulic conductance for the simulation. The conductance k behaves proportionally to the pre-set opening level with these components L. If kmax is the conductance resulting from the specified hydraulic resistance (opening level 100%), then k is calculated as follows:

Two hydraulic ports are connected in FluidSIM using a hydraulic line. This can be a simple connection or a T-junction. The simulation does not take pressure loss into account by this type of connection - the pressure is equal at all combined ports.    Should a pressure loss in the system be simulated, then the component "hose" can be used, which is modeled with a flow rate model with a constant cross-section p1_3_4. The volume of the hydraulic line and the mass of the hydraulic fluid are disregarded.

The following items, amongst others, belong to the class of components with pressure dependent cross-section: non-return valves, pressure control valves and pressure compensators.    The flow rate is calculated using the flow rate model for turbulent flow p1_2_1_4_4. The resistance is not constant by these components, instead it dependent upon the pressure ratios. The hydraulic resistance for these components can be specified at the maximum opening, which is internally converted to the maximum conductance kmax.    The flow is released against a spring (e.g. non-return valves) or blocked (e.g. pressure control valves). The adjustable nominal pressure is internally converted to a spring preload. The distance covered towards the spring, is proportional to the acting forces that are defined by the acting pressures and effective areas.  The actual conductance k is proportional to the distance covered.    The effects of friction and mass of the moving components are not considered in FluidSIM.

Model of the configurable way valve
Mathematical models
The flow rate through a way valve is modeled similar to a component with constant cross-section p1_3_4.  The hydraulic resistance always relates to one leading edge.    A complex model was created for the switching characteristics, which takes the adjacent forces, area ratios, pilot control and switching times into account.    The switching times cannot be changed by the user. In FluidSIM the following realistic switching times have been permanently set:    ·	20 ms to activate the valve  ·	30 ms for the valve to return through spring tension    Whether or not a way valve switches, depends on the balance of the adjacent forces that can arise from a solenoid valve, a mechanical or a hydraulic activation. At the main stage, a force of at least 20 N and for the pilot stage at least 15 N is necessary. The way valve can always be overridden by the user. The spring return is only active when the switching force exceeds 20 N.    The following activation forces are set permanently in FluidSIM:    ·	25 N by an electrical activation  ·	30 N by a mechanical activation  ·	F = p · A (with A = 1 cm2) by a hydraulic activation with a normal and dominating signal respectively  ·	F = p · A (with A = 0.5 cm2) by a hydraulic activation with a non-dominating signal    If you have configured a way valve with a pilot control, then the activation forces refer to the pilot stage, which switches by 15 N. The hydraulic fluid, which switches the main stage via the pilot stage, can be applied internally or externally. For an external supply, a separate port is available. For an internal supply, the hydraulic fluid is tapped from a main stage port. This is port P by the 2/n-, 3/n and 4/n way valves, by all others it is port A.

Model of the 2-way flow control valve
Mathematical models
The flow control valve holds the volumetric flow constant, independent of the adjacent pressure difference and the temperature of the hydraulic fluid. This is achieved using a measuring orifice which holds the pressure difference to a large extent constant. As the measuring orifice has a constant (adjustable) resistance, the volumetric flow also remains largely constant (see resistance of orifices p1_2_1_4_4_1).    As can be seen in the illustration, FluidSIM models the flow control valve with an upstream (closing) pressure compensator. Should a downstream pressure compensator be used, then these components can be recreated using a pressure compensator and an orifice.    The following applies to the equilibrium of forces at the pressure compensator by neglection of the flow-, inertia- and friction forces:

The pressure difference p2 - p3 above the measuring orifice is therefore kept constant and the resulting volumetric flow remains constant and is only dependent upon the resistance of the measuring orifice. This is, however, only true when the pressure difference p2 - p3 reaches at least the spring force. The minimum pressure difference in FluidSIM is 0.1 MPa (1 bar).    Two parameters can be defined in FluidSIM:    ·	nominal flow rate q0  ·	hydraulic resistance RH of the fully opened pressure compensator    By specifying the nominal flow rate q0, the user does not need to calculate the resistance of the measuring orifice manually. The following flow rate equation is valid for a measuring orifice with a minimum pressure difference of 0.1 MPa:

Model of the 3-way flow control valve
Mathematical models
The flow control valve holds the volumetric flow constant, independent of the adjacent pressure difference and the temperature of the hydraulic fluid. This is achieved using a measuring orifice which holds the pressure difference to a large extent constant. As the measuring orifice has a constant (adjustable) resistance, the volumetric flow also remains largely constant (see resistance of orifices p1_2_1_4_4_1).    The surplus hydraulic fluid is drained using an (opening) pressure compensator. The inlet pressure p1 is load dependent, i.e it changes with the outlet pressure p2. Therefore a parallel circuit of several 3-way flow control valves is not possible. In this case, the inlet pressures would be defined by the valve with the lowest inlet pressure. Compared to the 2-way flow control valve, the 3-way flow control valve is admittedly  more efficient in its' energy consumption.     The following applies to the equilibrium of forces at the pressure compensator by neglection of the flow-, inertia- and friction forces:

The configurable cylinder can be customized via its properties dialog 813. Almost any combination of piston type (single-acting, double-acting), the specification of the piston rods (double ended, with magnetic coupling or slide) and the number (none, one, two) is possible. An end position cushioning (without, with, adjustable) can also be defined. FluidSIM automatically adjusts the symbol according to the preset configuration.  In addition, a load to be moved (including possible static and sliding friction) and a variable force profile can be defined in the properties dialog 813.  In the component library from FluidSIM there are several pre-configured cylinders that can be inserted in your circuit and directly used.

A hydraulic connection is a place where a hydraulic line can be attached to. To simplify the line drawing process, a connection appears as a small circle in Edit Mode.   Hydraulic connections can be shut by means of a blind plug. An open hydraulic connection may result in leaking oil; FluidSIM-H thus pops up a warning message, if some hydraulic connection was left open.   Note that at each hydraulic connection values for the flow and pressure can be displayed.

The reservoir enables the performance of a hydraulic system to be optimized. For example, it can be utilized as an energy reservoir and for the absorbance of pressure surges or flow fluctuations. Reservoirs are capable of absorbing a defined volume of fluid under pressure and releasing it again with minimal losses. The construction consists essentially of a pressure resistant container, generally a gas charge of nitrogen and a separator e.g. a piston, a membrane or a bubble elastomer.   Hydraulic fluid only starts to flow into the reservoir when the fluid pressure is greater than the gas-preload pressure.

The 2/2-way cartridge valve is a 2/2-way valve. It is fitted with two working ports and the two switch positions closed and open. Whether or not the cartridge valve is open or closed depends on the effective areas A, B and X, the adjacent pressures pA, pB and pX, as well as the spring force. A+B=X is valid.   If pA*A + pB*B > pX*X + F, then the valve opens, otherwise it is closed.   The valve therefore operates purely pressure dependent and can, with the appropriate control, assume directional-, flow- and pressure functions. The spring force is specified by means of the nominal pressure. This is the minimum pressure, with pressureless connections at B and X, necessary at connection A to open the valve.   Whether the valve has one (A=B) or two (A <> B) effective areas can be specified in the properties window. The relevant symbol is automatically depicted.   The hydraulic resistance relates to the completely opened valve.  Adjustable parameters  	Area:	0 ... 100 qcm	(6)  	Nominal pressure:	0 ... 1 MPa	(0.1)  	Hydraulic resistance:	1e-7 ... 100 MPa*min2/l2	(0.001)

With sufficient pressure, the preset flow rate is kept constant in the direction of the arrow. The surplus hydraulic fluid is drained at connection T using a pressure compensator. The inlet pressure pA is load dependent, i.e it changes with the outlet pressure pB. Therefore a parallel circuit of several 3-way flow control valves is not possible. In this case, the inlet pressures would be defined by the valve with the lowest inlet pressure. Compared to the 2-way flow control valve, the 3-way flow control valve is admittedly more efficient in its energy consumption.   The hydraulic resistance relates to the completely closed pressure compensator.  Adjustable parameters  	Nominal flow:	0.01 ... 500 l/min	(1)  	Hydraulic resistance:	1e-7 ... 100 MPa*min2/l2	(0.01)

The regulating valve transforms an analog electrical input signal into corresponding opening cross-sections at the outputs. The setpoint signal must be within the range -10 V to +10 V. At 0 V the hydraulic mid-position is adopted and the valve stops the flow (in relation to the null overlap).   The cross section area of the flow opening widens with increasing slide distance. How far the area, and with it the flow at the valve, changes depends on the shape and form of the control notches. A triangular shaped notch results in a progressive flow behavior, a rectangular shaped notch in a linear flow behavior.   The hydraulic resistance relates to a completely opened leading edge and the internal leakage relates to one leading edge as appropriate. The overlap of the leading edges can be specified relative to the maximal slide distance.   By the use of an integrated electronic position controller for the slide distance, beneficial static and dynamic characteristics are achieved that are manifested in a minimal hysteresis (less than 0,2 %) and a response time of less than 12 ms at a signal change of 0 - 100 %.   Adjustable parameters  	Hydraulic resistance:	1e-7 ... 100 MPa*min2/l2	(0.14)  	Internal leakage:	0 ... 100 l/(min*MPa)	(0.0026)

The proportional pressure relief valve, with the assistance of a proportional amplifier, is a continuous, electrically adjustable pressure relief valve. The control piston has two adjacent areas exposed to pressure. The first area is exposed to the pressure at connection P, the other to connection T. If the magnet is not supplied with electricity, then the piston is fully retracted and the complete passage from connection P to connection T is free. The proportional magnet creates a force proportional to its magnetic current, which moves the control piston according to the balance of the adjacent forces (magnetic force, spring force and pressures).   The control voltage must be in the range 0 V to 10 V. The minimum nominal pressure defines the opening pressure through the spring force at 0 V. The maximum nominal pressure defines the opening pressure at 10 V. The hydraulic resistance relates to the completely opened main stage leading edge.  Adjustable parameters  	Hydraulic resistance:	1e-7 ... 100 MPa*min2/l2	(0.01)

The pilot operated pressure relief valve consists of a pilot stage with poppet valve and a main stage with control slide valve. The pressure at connection P acts upon the pilot poppet via a drilling in the control slide valve.   If the force of the proportional magnet is greater than the pressure exercised at connection P, then the pilot stage remains closed. A spring keeps the main stage poppet valve closed and the flow rate is null.   If the force, that the pressure exercises, exceeds the closing force of the pilot poppet, then this opens. A lower flow rate develops from connection P to connection Y. The flow of fluid causes a pressure loss at the throttle valve inside the control slide valve. Thus the pressure at the spring side is lower than the pressure at connection P. Due to the pressure difference, the control slide valve opens so far until the spring force re-establishes an equilibrium of forces and the valve is perfused from P to T.   The control voltage must be between 0 V and 10 V. The minimum nominal pressure defines the opening pressure at the pilot stage via the spring force at 0 V. The maximum nominal pressure defines the opening pressure at 10 V. The hydraulic resistance relates to the completely opened main stage leading edge.  Adjustable parameters  	Hydraulic resistance:	1e-7 ... 100 MPa*min2/l2	(0.01)

The pilot operated proportional pressure regulator valve consists of a pilot stage with poppet valve and a main stage with control slide valve. The pressure at connection A acts upon the pilot poppet via a drilling in the control slide valve. The proportional magnet exercises the electrically adjustable counter force with the assistance of a proportional amplifier.   If the pressure at connection A is below the preset value, then the pilot control remains closed. The pressure on both sides of the control slide valve is equal. A spring holds the main stage control slide valve open and the hydraulic fluid flow freely from connection P to connection A.   If the pressure at connection A exceeds the preset value, then the pilot stage opens causing less volumetric flow to flow to connection A. The pressure falls at the throttle valve inside the control slide valve. Thus the pressure at the spring side is lower than the pressure at connection A. Due to the pressure difference, the control slide valve closes so far until the spring force re-establishes an equilibrium of forces. As a result, the flow resistance at the control edge between connections P and A increases and the pressure at connection A sinks.   The control voltage must be between 0 V and 10 V. The minimum nominal pressure defines the opening pressure at the pre stage via the spring force at 0 V. The maximum nominal pressure defines the opening pressure at 10 V. The hydraulic resistance relates to the completely opened main stage leading edge.  Adjustable parameters  	Hydraulic resistance:	1e-7 ... 100 MPa*min2/l2	(0.01)

The status controller is especially suitable for controlling pneumatic positioning circuits. A pneumatic positioning circuit counts to the controlled systems that can only be unsatisfactorily controlled with a standard controller. Three parameters can be attributed to the present status controller: position, speed and acceleration of the piston. The controller is therefore referred to as a triple loop controller. Speed and acceleration are not measured with sensors out of cost reasons. They are calculated by the controller from the differences in position. The adjustable parameters refer to the status controller in the Technology Package TP511 Closed-loop hydraulics from Festo Didactic.   The output voltage restriction can be set within the range (i) -10 V to + 10 V or (ii) 0 V to +10 V. In the range (i), a manipulated variable offset from -7 V to + 7 V can be specified, and in the range (ii) a manipulated variable offset from 1.5 V to 8.5 V can be specified.

The function generator is a voltage source that can create constant, rectangle, sine and triangle signals. The voltage range is restricted to -10 V to +10 V. The frequency, the amplitude and the Y-offset of the signal can be set within this range.   A voltage profile can be additionally specified. Data points can be set interactively with a mouse-click in the relevant graphic field. These can then be combined to a closed polygon. Alternatively, existing data points can be marked and both numeric values for the time and the corresponding voltage can be entered in the input fields. If the option loop is selected, then the voltage profile is started again.  Adjustable parameters  	Frequency:	0 ... 100 Hz	(1)  	Amplitude:	0 ... 10 V	(5)  	y offset:	-10 ... 10 V	(5)

Voltage profiles in the range -10 V to +10 V can be created using the setpoint value card. Up to 8 setpoints W1 to W8 can be specified in the voltage range -10 V to +10 V. The setpoint card requires a power supply of 24 V.   The increase from the current setpoint to the next setpoint is defined using 4 ramps R1 to R4 with values between 0 s/V and 10 s/V, i.e. a low ramp value signifies a large increase, whereas a high ramp value results in a small increase. The active ramp is defined as follows: R1 by a positive increase of 0 V, R2 by a negative increase up to 0 V, R3 by a negative increase of 0 V and R4 by a positive increase up to 0 V.   Three operating modes can be selected: Wait for switching time, Advance setpoints and External control.   In operating mode Wait for switching time the setpoints are sequentially advanced when the preset change over time has expired.   If Advance setpoints is selected then, upon attaining the active setpoint, the next setpoint is started without delay.   In operating mode External control the selection of the active setpoint is effected by gating the inputs I1, I2 and I3 with at least 15 V. The corresponding setpoint is selected by means of the specified bit table. During the process, the internal switching time is inactive.

Digital inputs are designated with an I. In FluidSIM digital components can be used inside and outside a digital module.   If a digital input is used inside a digital module, you can determine the input connector of the digital module in question with which the digital input shall be linked by allocating a number I1 to I16. If there is an analog signal of more than 10V at the chosen input of the digital module, the digital input is set to Hi.   If a digital input is used outside a digital module, there is an additional analog electrical connection at the digital input. If there is an analog signal of more than 10V at this connection, the digital input is set to Hi.   As an alternative you can click on the digital input with the left mouse button in order to set it to Hi. Another click resets the value to Lo.

Digital outputs are designated with an Q. The output connects a digital signal through from its input to its output. In FluidSIM digital components can be used inside and outside a digital module.   If a digital output is used inside a digital module, you can determine the output connector of the digital module in question with which the digital output shall be linked by allocating a number Q1 to Q16. If the status of the digital output is Hi, a potential of 24V is set at the corresponding output connector of the digital module.   If a digital output is used outside a digital module, there is an additional analog electrical connection at the digital output. If the status of the digital output is Hi, a potential of 24 V is set a this connection.

The digital module is used for a compact embedding of a digital switching circuit into a electrohydraulic circuit. The digital module offers 8 (16) electrical inputs and outputs, which transfer their states to its digital switching circuit in the inner part. Therefore the digital switching circuit does not need much space in the electrohydraulic circuit for the display of the digital module as a rectangle with a total number of 18 (34) connections. By making a double-click with the left mouse button on the digital module you come to the digital circuit in the inner part of the module. A new window opens. It shows the digital circuit and can be handled in the usual way. The standard configuration in the inner part of a new inserted digital module is a row with 8 (16) inputs and 8 (16) outputs each. They correspond to the inputs and outputs of the module in the electrohydraulic circuit. In order to be able to test the digital circuit during the set-up, it can be simulated separated from the electrohydraulic circuit. As soon as the processing window of the digital module is closed or the original circuit window is put into the foreground, the previously effected changes in the digital circuit are automatically adopted into the digital module of the electrohydraulic circuit. Inside the digital module only digital components can be inserted. Furthermore, an encapsulating of additional digital modules inside a module is not possible. However, you can use several digital modules in one electrohydraulic circuit. Please note that the digital circuit inside a digital module only works correctly if corresponding potentials are set at the electrical power supply units of the module (+24 V) and (0 V).

Depending on the configuration of the input Dir, an internal value is counted up or down through an input pulse. The output is set when the configured count value is reached.   With every status change at the input Cnt from Lo to Hi, the internal counter is increased (Dir = Lo) or decreased (Dir = Hi) by one unit. If the internal counter is equal or larger compared to the specified value, the output Q is set to Hi.   You can use the reset input R to reset the internal count value and the output to Lo. As long as R=Hi, also the output is Lo and the pulses at input Cnt are not counted.  Adjustable parameters  	Counter:	0 ... 9999 pulses	(5)

Throttle and orifice valves are used to achieve a certain pressure drop. This is done by creating a specific flow resistance. The needle flow control valve shown generates considerable friction due to its long narrowing. This means that the action of the flow control valve is difficult to adjust due to the fact that a small adjustment produces a large change in cross-section.      One advantage is the simple and inexpensive design. Needle flow control valves can be used if the above- mentioned negative properties can be ignored for the purposes of a given control task.

The advancing piston rod encounters a load half-way through its stroke. The flow control valve nonetheless ensures that the advance speed remains constant. From 0 to 2 seconds (shown at bottom right) the piston rod is unloaded and the pressure conditions remain constant. When the piston rod encounters the load, the pressure p3 rises at the outlet of the flow control valve. (In order to allow the rapid control operations to be shown more clearly, the time scale now changes to 1/100ths of a second.) The flow control valve briefly raises the pressure p2 downstream of the adjustable restrictor. Following this, the regulating restrictor moves to the left, and p2 falls back to its original value, i.e. the pressure difference between p1 and p2 remains constant. The regulating operation shown is repeated a number of times, as the result of which p3 increases to 2.5 MPa (25 bar) in several steps and the regulating restrictor opens more and more. (At the point at which 2.5 MPa (25 bar) is reached, the time scale changes back to 0.1 seconds.) The piston rod now travels under load just as fast as previously without load.

Throttle and orifice valves control the volumetric flow rate in conjunction with a pressure relief valve. The PRV opens when the resistance of the flow control valve becomes greater than that of the opening pressure set on the PRV. This produces a division of flow.      The volumetric flow to the load device varies, i.e. the action of flow control valves is load-dependent.

The one-way flow control valve is a combination of an orifice or throttle valve and a non-return valve. In the closed direction shown of the non-return valve, the volumetric flow passes via the variable throttle gap, which creates a considerable resistance.      Speed reduction can be achieved by using a one-way flow control valve in conjunction with a pressure relief valve or a variable-delivery pump. The pressure rises upstream of the flow control valve until the PRV opens and routes part of the flow to the tank.

Flow control valves have the task of providing constant volumetric flow independently of pressure changes at the inlet or outlet of the valve. This is achieved firstly by means of an adjustable restrictor which is set to the desired volumetric flow. In order to keep the pressure drop across the throttle point constant, a second regulating restrictor (pressure compensator) is also required. The illustration shows the valve in its normal position.      2-way flow control valves always operate in conjunction with a pressure relief valve. The part of the flow which is not required is discharged via the PRV.

When fluid flows through the valve, the pressure drop across the adjustable restrictor is kept constant by the pressure compensator, which varies the resistance at the upper throttle point in accordance with the load at the inlet or outlet.

In the case of this flow control valve, the pressure difference is kept constant by a adjustable restrictor, i.e. between p1 and p2. If the pressure p3 rises as the result of an external load, the overall resistance of the valve is reduced by opening the regulating restrictor.

In the case of a single acting cylinder, only the piston side is pressurized with hydraulic fluid. The cylinder can thus carry out work only in one direction. The fluid which flows into the piston chamber causes a pressure to build up the surface of the piston. The piston travels into its forward end position. The return stroke is effected by a spring, the dead weight of the piston rod or an external load.

In the case of double acting cylinders, both piston surfaces can be pressurized. A working movement can thus be performed in both directions.      With double acting cylinders with a single-sided piston rod, different forces and speeds are obtained on the advance and return strokes due to the difference in area between the piston surface and annular piston surface.

Cylinder with end position cushioning are used to brake high stroke speeds smoothly and prevent hard impacts at the end of the stroke. Shortly before the end position is reached, the cross- section for the outflow of fluid is reduced by the built-in cushioning pistons and then finally closed. The hydraulic fluid is then forced to escape through a flow control valve.

When the cylinder is retracted, the piston of the bleed valve is closed. It is lifted as the piston rod advances. Air can then escape via the bleed hole until the hydraulic fluid reaches the piston and pushes it upwards. In the forward end position, the piston is pushed fully upwards by the hydraulic fluid and thus provides an external seal.      Bleed valves should be fitted at the highest point in a piping system, since this is where any trapped air will collect.

The slide on a horizontal grinding machine is hydraulically actuated. A machine operator determines that the reciprocating movement of the machine is no longer reaching the desired speed. A possible cause of this is reduced pump delivery. To investigate this, it is necessary to plot a characteristic curve for the pump and compare this with the values achieved during initial commissioning. As an additional exercise, the circuit diagram and parts list for the necessary test assembly should be prepared.  In order to draw the characteristic curve for the pump, the volumetric flow of hydraulic fluid delivered by the pump (Q) is plotted against the operating pressure achieved (p). The manufacturer's characteristic curve exhibits a slight downward gradient, since the new pump manifests increasing internal leakage losses as necessary to provide internal lubrication. The newly-plotted curve shows a clear deviation; the leakage oil losses have become greater at higher operating pressures, the volumetric efficiency has become worse. The main reason for this is pump wear. Regarding the circuit diagram for the test assembly: The adjustable flow control valve 1V3 is adjusted in such a way that the pressure gauge 1Z1 shows the desired system pressure. The pressure relief valve 1V2 is used to limit the system pressure, while valve 1V1 acts as a safety valve for the pump.  The measured values taken as the basis for this exercise do not allow for the characteristic curve of the electric motor. The motor characteristic thus forms part of the calculated error.

The sliding bed of a parallel planing machine is actuated with the aid of a hydraulic control system. The power section of this hydraulic control system consists of a double acting differential cylinder. The area ratio of the full piston surface of this cylinder to the annular piston surface is 2:1. Since the piston-rod chamber is only half the volume of the piston chamber, the return stroke is twice as fast as the advance stroke. Machining has previously been carried out only during the advance stroke. In future, working movements are to be carried out in both directions. To make this possible, the hydraulic control system must be modified so that forward and return strokes are at the same speed. The speed should now also be adjustable. The connecting lines should be added to the given circuit diagram. The mode of operation of the circuit in the three switching positions should be described and the various piston speeds and forces compared.  In order to achieve the same speed on the advance and return strokes, a differential circuit (by-pass circuit) can be used with differential cylinders with an area ratio of 2:1. Picture 116.2 The second picture shows the principle of a by-pass circuit with a 3/2-way valve. In the case of the parallel planing machine, the necessary differential circuit can be achieved by using the mid-position of a 4/3-way valve (A, B and P connected, T closed). In this switching position (advance stroke), the piston speed and force are twice as high as in the right-hand switching position (return stroke). In the left-hand switching position, on the other hand, the advance stroke is half as fast and the force twice as great as in the other two switching positions. The speed for the advance and return strokes can be adjusted by means of a flow control valve fitted upstream.  It should also be noted that only half the force is available on the advance stroke at the mid-position. In the case of a tractive load, the by-pass position has the advantage that the piston is hydraulically clamped. Differential circuits are used not only as synchronization circuits but also as rapid-traverse circuits when, for example, different speeds are required in the same direction with constant pump delivery. If it is desired to calculate forces and piston speeds using concrete values, the model values given in the TP 501 textbook can be used for this purpose.

The drill feed and clamping device of a drilling machine are hydraulically actuated. The hydraulic control system contains two cylinders, a clamping cylinder 1A and a feed cylinder 2A. The clamping pressure at cylinder 1A must be adjustable, since different workpiece clamping forces are required. A pressure regulator is used for this. The return stroke of the clamping cylinder must be at maximum speed. The drilling feed must be adjustable for various feed speeds, which must however remain constant under varying load. It should also be noted that the drive spindle fitted to the piston rod of the drilling cylinder acts as a tractive load. The return stroke of the drilling cylinder should also be at maximum speed. A circuit should be drafted with the above-mentioned characteristics.  Pressure regulators can as general principle be used to reduce the general system pressure in a part of a hydraulic installation. If we consider the two control chains for the drilling machine without pressure regulation, we can observe the following undesirable effects: When 1V1 is actuated, the workpiece is first clamped at full system pressure. If 2V1 is now actuated, the system pressure will drop to the operating pressure of the drilling cylinder. The same applies to the pressure at the clamping cylinder. If the circuit is expanded to include the pressure regulator 1V3, this enables the clamping pressure to be adjusted. The system pressure upstream of the PRV will, however, continue to fall during the advance stroke of 2A. In order to maintain the preset clamping pressure at outlet A of the PRV reliably, the pressure at inlet P must be higher than this. This can be achieved by fitting the additional flow control valve 0V2 upstream of the final control element 2V1. Maximum return-stroke speed is achieved for the clamping cylinder by means of 1V2, which is used to by-pass 1V3. The flow control valve 2V3 means that the advance-stroke speed of the drilling cylinder is independent of load and adjustable. Due to the tractive load of the attached spindle, however, an additional PRV must be fitted as a back-pressure valve. The non-return valves 2V2 and 2V5 provide a by-pass during the return stroke and allow maximum speed to be achieved during this.  A parts list can be specified to help in the drafting of this circuit.

A bending machine is used to bend steel plates. The bending tools are driven by hydraulic cylinders. It is now desired to use the bending machine for considerably thicker steel plates than before. This requires a hydraulic system pressure of 45 bar against the previous 30 bar. According to the manufacturer's data, the pump used is suitable for the higher operating pressure. Testing reveals, however, that the bending process is now much too slow. In this case, leakage losses in the piping or directional control valve are ruled out as the cause of the problem. A directly-controlled pressure relief valve (PRV) is installed as a safety valve. Measurements of the volumetric flow (Q) as a function of pressure (p) are available for this valve. A characteristic curve can than be used to determine whether the loss of speed in the bending process is due to the PRV.  The volumetric flow which is discharged to the tank when the PRV opens is entered on the horizontal axis. The characteristic curve shows that the opening point of the PRV is 44 bar, although it is set to 50 bar. This means that part of the pump delivery is diverted at pressures greater than 44 bar. Pressures of more than 44 bar are achieved during the bending process. Since, however, the flow is divided from 44 bar onwards, the volumetric flow to the cylinder is reduced from this point and the bending process slows down. Measure to be taken: The PRTV can be set to 60 bar if the overall installation has been designed for this higher pressure. Flow diversion will then take place from a pressure of 54 bar onwards.  An alternative solution would be to use a valve with a different response pressure.

Steel blocks are transported on a roller conveyor. A hydraulic transfer station makes it possible to transfer blocks from one track to another. A pressure of at least 30 bar is required for the transfer of blocks by means of hydraulic cylinders. Every component through which the hydraulic fluid flows represents a resistance and causes a constant pressure loss. The question is, what pressure is to be set at the pressure relief valve.  The total resistance is the sum of all the individual resistances. The resistance must be determined separately for the advance and return strokes. The overall balances do not include data for the pressure losses at the 4/2-way valve. These can be determined from the flow characteristic for the 4/2-way valve, based on a volumetric flow of 8 l/min. In the calculation, allowance must be made for the resistance of the directional control valve on the inlet and outlet sides respectively. Allowance must also be made for the pressure intensification factor of 2:1 in the case of the differential cylinder. This enables values to be calculated as shown in the solution figure. In the case of the advance stroke, 6 bar hysteresis for the PRV (see exercise 164 p3_1_13_2) must be added to the calculated 42.5 bar in order to ensure that the opening pressure is higher than the required operating pressure. The value finally chosen is 50 bar in order to make allowance for unknown variables such as pipe elbows and the static friction in the cylinder.  In order to keep pressure losses in large installations to a minimum, it is advisable to select valves on the basis of their flow characteristics. It is better to select a valve which is one size too large than to accept large pressure losses. This furthermore reduces wear resulting from cavitation in the valves.

Additional hydraulic components are to be added to an embossing press to eject the finished workpieces. A single acting cylinder (1A) is to be fitted for this purpose. A proposed solution in the form of a circuit diagram with a 2/2-way valve is to be examined to see if it is suitable for this control problem. Following this, a circuit diagram with a 3/2-way valve as final control element is to be developed and a parts list prepared. A comparison is to be made of the behavior of these two circuits during the advance and return strokes.  When a 2/2-way valve is used to activate a single acting cylinder, the final control element must be reversed and the hydraulic power unit switched off in order to retract the piston rod. The load acting on the piston rod must be larger than the resistance of the directional control valve. This solution cannot be used due to the presence of the second control chain (embossing cylinder). If a 3/2-way valve is used, a direct switch-over can be made from the advance stroke to the return stroke without switching off the hydraulic power unit. Halting at overlap positions, on the other hand (which are not required here), would be possible only by switching off the hydraulic power unit.  The non-return valve fitted in each case protects the pump against oil back-pressure. This is necessary in case the hydraulic power unit is switched off with the cylinder advanced and under load.

Liquid aluminum is transferred from a holding furnace into a channel leading to a die-casting machine. A ladle is required for this. A double acting cylinder is used to enable the ladle to carry out the appropriate movements. A circuit diagram is provided for the activation of the cylinder with a 4/2-way valve as final control element. This must be examined to see if it is suitable for the control task concerned. The ladle must not be allowed to dip into the furnace when the valve is not actuated. A circuit diagram with a back-pressure valve must be developed to cater for the case in which the ladle is very heavy.  The requirements of the exercise are met by the first circuit diagram only if the ladle represents a light load. If the ladle is very heavy, the advance speed could rise to an unacceptably high level during the advance stroke of the piston rod (ladle moving towards furnace), and the ladle could as a result plunge too quickly into the molten metal. This can be prevented by installing a back- pressure valve in the B line between the valve and cylinder (tractive load).  If, as is required in this exercise, the power component must positively assume a defined end position when the installation is at rest, valves with spring return must be used, as in this case. Here, a 4/2-way valve with spring return has been used, since this ensures that the cylinder remains in the desired position if the hydraulic power unit is switched on unexpectedly. The required cylinder diameter and the return speed of the piston rod can also be calculated as additional optional tasks in the exercise: see the model calculations in the textbook.

Workpieces are fed continuously through a paint drying oven on a conveyor belt. In order to minimize the heat loss through the door, this should be opened only as much as required by the height of the workpieces. The hydraulic control system should be designed so that the door can be held reliably in position for a long period of time without slipping down. Firstly, a 4/3-way valve with suitable mid-position functions should be selected as a final control element. Secondly, a delockable non-return valve should be provided in the circuit diagram to act as a hydraulic safety device to prevent slippage of the door under load (i.e. its own weight) over a long period of time as the result of leakage losses in the directional control valve. The question is, which type of 4/3-way valve has a suitable mid-position function?  A 4/3-way valve with an all ports closed mid-position will solve the problem only if a poppet valve is used. If a slide valve would be used, the oven door would slip down slowly as the result of internal leakage losses.  The second solution would be to fit a delockable non- return valve in the supply line to the piston rod side of the cylinder downstream of the directional control valve. In order to ensure that the non-return valve closes immediately when the door stops, both the outlets A and B of the directional control valve to the tank must be de-pressurized (A, B and T connected, P closed).

Workpieces are clamped by a hydraulic cylinder. The closing speed must be reduced in order to prevent damage to the workpieces. The opening speed must, however, be maintained. The question here is how to incorporate the necessary one-way flow control valve in the circuit. Possible solutions must be examined to see what thermal side- effects occur and to determine the pressure load placed on the components concerned.  The advance stroke can as a general principle be made slower by using either inlet or outlet flow control. Either solution can be used in this control; in comparison with outlet flow control, inlet flow control has the advantage that no pressure intensification will take place. The oil heated at the throttle point will, however, then pass through the power component. The resulting expansion of material is not, however, of significance for this simple vice. If the solution with outlet flow control is selected, it should be borne in mind that pressure intensification will take place in accordance with the area ratio of the differential cylinder of 2:1. The pressure relief valve will respond, i.e. flow division will occur, only when a pressure has built up on the piston-rod side which is approximately twice as high as the system pressure set on the PRV. The cylinder, flow control valve and connectors used must therefore be suitable for this intensified pressure.  Precision drives for machine tools are a good example of cases in which it is essential to make allowance for expansion of the material of power components due to the passage through these of heated oil.

Press tools of varying weights are inserted into a press by means of a hydraulic crane. A double acting cylinder raises and lowers the load. During the commissioning of the hydraulic crane, it has become apparent that the advance speed of the piston rod is too high. The solutions have been proposed to reduce this speed; a circuit with exhaust flow control and a circuit with a back-pressure valve. A suitable solution must be selected and reasons stated for this choice. Since the second solution is not capable of operating in this form, this must be rectified by correcting the circuit diagram.  If the solution with exhaust flow control is selected, it must be borne in mind that the cylinder, flow control valve and connectors must be suitable for this intensified pressure. The solution chosen is the circuit with the back-pressure valve; in this case, the load is clamped hydraulically and a pressure-intensification effect does not occur, since the pressure can be adjustable by means of the pressure relief valve as appropriate to the load. A non-return valve must be installed to provide a by-pass on the return stroke.  Inlet flow control cannot be used to control a tractive load; the load forces oil out of the piston-rod chamber faster than oil can flow into the piston chamber. Vacuum is created and air will escape.

The feed movement of a lathe has previously been carried out manually. In future, this is to be performed automatically by a hydraulic control system. The feed movement must be adjustable and remain constant even with changing tool loads. Since a simple throttle valve is not able to provide a constant feed speed under changing load, a 2-way flow control valve must be used. On the basis of a circuit diagram with data for the no- load situation, values for pressures, pressure differences and feed speed under load must be added. The circuit diagram must be modified to ensure that the flow control valve is not operative on the return stroke. Finally, the relationship must be investigated between Q of the PRV and the feed speed and between D p2 and the volumetric flow to the load device.  In order to prevent the flow control valve from acting as a resistance on the return stroke, a non-return valve is installed parallel to this as a by-pass. The pressure at the PRV remains constant despite the effect of the load. The outlet flow from this is therefore a constant 7 l/min. A constant volumetric flow Q at the PRV in turn means a constant volumetric flow to the load device and thus constant feed speed. Regarding the last question: No matter whether operation is with or without a load, the pressure drop D p2 at the adjustable throttle remains constant. A constant pressure drop means a constant volumetric flow.  Regarding the necessity for the non-return valve in the by-pass: When flow passes through 2-way flow control valves in the reverse direction, they act either as flow control valves if the regulating restrictor is fully open or non-return valves if the regulating restrictor is closed.

First of all the control chain is numbered sequentially according to the principle. The first actuator is given the supplementary number .0 and the associated final control element the supplementary number .1. The remaining elements get even numbers if they influence the advance stroke and uneven numbers if they influence the return stroke.      The numbering should always be entered in the circuit diagram and also on the machine to enable systematic fault-finding.

Hydrostatic pressure can generally be ignored for the purpose of studying hydraulics (exception: see topic 2 p3_1_1_2).

Motion energy is required for an increase in the flow velocity of the oil at a restriction. This motion energy is derived from the pressure energy. If the vacuum which results is smaller than -30 kPa (-0.3 bar), air dissolved in the oil is precipitated out. When the pressure rises again due to a reduction in speed, the oil bursts into the gas bubbles.      Cavitation is a significant factor in hydraulic systems as a cause of wear in devices and connections.

The fluid pressure p1 exerts a force F1 on the surface A1 which is transferred via the piston rod to the small piston. The force F1 thus acts on the surface A2 and produces the fluid pressure p2 . Since the piston area A2 is smaller than the piston area A1, the pressure p2 must be larger than the pressure p1.       The pressure-transfer (pressure-intensification) effect is put to practical use in pneumatic/hydraulic pressure intensifiers and also in purely hydraulic systems when extremely high pressures are required which a pump cannot deliver.

In mobile hydraulic systems, on the other hand, the reservoir contains only the maximum quantity of hydraulic fluid required.

It is important that the effectiveness of a filter can be checked by a contamination indicator. The contamination of a filter is measured by the pressure drop; as the contamination increases, the pressure upstream of the filter increases. The pressure acts on a spring- loaded piston. As the pressure increases, the piston is pushed against a spring.      There are a number of different display methods. Either the piston movement is directly visible or it is converted into an electrical or visual indication by electrical contacts.

The operating temperature in hydraulic installations should not exceed 50 - 60ºC, since this would cause an unacceptable reduction in viscosity, leading to premature aging of the fluid. In comparison with air cooling, operating costs a higher due to the required coolant and the susceptibility to corrosion. Temperature difference of up to approx. 35ºC can be handled.

The switching characteristics of a valve are governed by, among other things, its piston overlap. A distinction is made between positive, negative and zero overlap. In the case of positive overlap, the port in question is completely covered by the piston, while with negative overlap it is less than completely covered. In the case of zero overlap, the distances between the control edges of the piston and of the port are exactly the same.      The individual control edges of the pilot piston can have different overlaps.

In this design incorporating a poppet valve, a seal is pressed against the inlet port P by a pressure spring when the valve is in its normal position.      In this situation, for example, an unloaded piston rod is executing an advance stroke and the entire pump delivery is flowing to the cylinder.

This pressure relief valve controls the flow in accordance with an external pressure setting. This pressure acts against an adjustable spring force. The passage from the supply port P to the tank port T remains closed as long as no load acts on the pilot piston.

The example shows a circuit with a pressure relief valve used as a pressure sequence valve. The pressure at the pilot piston of the PRV rises via the pressure regulator. The PRV opens and the high-pressure pump delivers directly to the tank. As soon as the 2/2-way valve opens, the pressure drops. The pressure relief valve closes and the high pressure pump is connected to the system.

This valve is normally open. The outlet pressure (A) acts via a pilot line on the left-hand surface of the pilot piston against an adjustable spring force.      Pressure regulators reduce the inlet pressure to an adjustable outlet pressure. It is appropriate to use these in hydraulic installations only if different pressures are required.

When the pressure rises at outlet A, the force at the left-hand surface of the pilot piston becomes greater, the piston is displaced to the right and the throttle gap becomes narrower. This causes a pressure drop.      In the case of slide valves, it is also possible to design the control edges in such way that the opening gap increases only slowly. This gives greater control precision.

It is appropriate to use PRVs only when different pressures are required in an installation. The mod of operation of pressure regulator will thus be explained here by taking an example with two control circuits. The first control circuit acts via a flow control valve on a hydraulic motor which drives a roller. This roller is used to stick together multi-layered printed circuit boards. The second control circuit acts on a hydraulic cylinder which draws the roller towards the boards at an adjustable reduced pressure.      This example can be used as a preliminary stage to the introduction of the 3-way PR. If the 2-way PR is closed due to the fact that the preset maximum pressure has been reached, thickening of the material of the workpieces would cause an increase in the pressure on the outlet side of the PR to a higher value than desired.

Pressure relief valves often incorporate cushioning pistons or flow control valves. The cushioning device shown provides fast opening and slow closing of the valve. This prevents damage caused by pressure shocks (smooth valve operation).      Pressure shock arise, for example, when the pump delivers oil in an almost unpressurized condition and the supply port of the load device is abruptly closed by a directional control valve.

From the logic point of view, 4/3-way valves are 4/2- way valves with an additional mid-position. There are various versions of this mid-position (in the mid-position in the example shown, the supply port P is directly connected to the tank T, see next illustration p3_1_8_24). In the switching position shown, there is flow from P to B and from A to T.      4/3-way valves are easy to construct as slide valves and of complex design as poppet valves.

The 4/3-way valve is in its mid-position; there is flow from P to T, while A and B are closed. Since the output from the pump flows to the tank, this switching position is called pump bypass or also pump recirculation.      In the case of pump bypass, the pump needs to operate only against the resistance of the valve, which has a favorable effect on the power balance.

The circuit shows the 4/3-way valve in functional representation as a final control element of a double acting cylinder. The valve is in its mid-position; the pump delivery flows via the by-pass line within the pilot piston to the tank.      The non-return valve protects the pump in cases where the piston rod of the cylinder is subject to an external load.

The animations show the switching of the 4/3-way valve into the three switching positions and the corresponding cylinder movements. During the advance stroke, movement can be halted by switching to the mid- position.      As appropriate to the application in question, a circuit of this kind must be equipped with a brake valve to prevent damage to the installation when the valve is switched to the mid-position (see also topic 64 p3_1_7_6).

From the logic point of view, 4/3-way valves are 4/2- way valves with an additional mid-position. There are various versions of this mid-position (in the mid-position in the example shown, all ports are closed in the mid- position, see next illustration p3_1_8_30). In the switching position shown, there is flow from P to B and from A to T.

The valve is in its mid-position; the pump is operating against the system pressure set on the PRV.      If, with an operational installation, it is desired to switch to pump recirculation, this can be achieved by using an additional 2/2-way valve as a changeover valve (see part circuit-diagram in topic 94 p3_1_8_7).

In its initial position, the cylinder is advanced. If the 2/2- way valve 0V1 is actuated, the entire volumetric flow passes to the tank and piston rod of the cylinder is reset by the external load m. If 0V1 is not actuated, the system pressure set on the pressure limiter 0V2 builds up and the piston rod advances.      In the initial position, the pump operates against the preset system pressure, which has an unfavorable effect on the power balance of the circuit shown.

Non-return valves block flow in one direction and allow free flow in the other. In the direction of flow shown, the sealing element is pressed against a seat by a spring and the hydraulic fluid.      These valves are also available in designs without springs. Since there must be no leaks in the closed position, these valves are generally of poppet design.

The 4/2-way valve is actuated, the hydraulic fluid passes through the non-return valve against the force of the return spring and the piston rod advances. When the 4/2-way valve is reset, the outlet on the piston side is closed by the non-return valve, and the cylinder remains advanced. The 3/2-way valve is now actuated, the pilot piston is reversed and the outlet flow released; the piston rod begins to retract. During the return stroke, the 3/2-way valve is brought temporarily into its normal position. This causes the outlet to be closed again, and the piston rod and load remain in their current position. When the 3/2-way valve is actuated again, the piston rod travels to its retracted end position.
